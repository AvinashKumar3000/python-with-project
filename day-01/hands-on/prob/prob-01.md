# 🧮 **Question: Factorial of a Number**

**Q:**
Write a Python program to find the **factorial** of a given number.
The factorial of a number `n` (written as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

The formula is:
[
n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
]

---

## **Example:**

**Input:**

```
Enter a number: 5
```

**Process:**

```
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
```

**Output:**

```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

---

### **Explanation:**

When the user enters `5`,

* Multiply all numbers from 1 to 5 → `1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5`
* The result is `120`.
  This means **5! = 120**.

### **Python Code Example (Using Loop):**

```python
# TODO 
```

---

### **Explanation of Code:**

1. `num` → takes input from the user.
2. `fact` → initialized to `1` because multiplying by `0` would make everything zero.
3. `for i in range(1, num + 1)` → runs from 1 to the entered number.
4. Each time, it multiplies the current number `i` with `fact`.
5. Finally, it prints the result.

Would you like me to make the **same question using recursion** version too (for advanced students)?
